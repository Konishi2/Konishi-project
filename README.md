# Hello worl
This is a temporary fork of https://github.com/konishi-project so we can continue work on the project while Zeth is in the cooldown corner.

Everyone that is active in the project will get write privilege on the dev branch so if you already added some patches and/or know the right people, send me a pm for the write privilege.

When we have a working core product we'll merge dev over to master.
